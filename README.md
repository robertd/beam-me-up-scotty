Beam-me-up-Scotty
===========

Perhaps Capt'n Kirk was a huge Instagram fan. :)

Instructions: Click anywhere on the map to show available images in the radius... or ask Scotty to beam you somewhere else by clicking on blue `Beam Me Up` button :). Also you can see in the realtime where other people are clicking on the map (red circles).

Use `Hard Reset` button to delete complete "beaming" history and all users will instantly see the changes... thanks firebase.io :).  

Cheers!!!
